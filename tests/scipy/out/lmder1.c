/*     subroutine lmder1 */

/*     the purpose of lmder1 is to minimize the sum of the squares of */
/*     m nonlinear functions in n variables by a modification of the */
/*     levenberg-marquardt algorithm. this is done by using the more */
/*     general least-squares solver lmder. the user must provide a */
/*     subroutine which calculates the functions and the jacobian. */

/*     the subroutine statement is */

/*       subroutine lmder1(fcn,m,n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,tol,info, */
/*                         ipvt,wa,lwa) */

/*     where */

/*       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which */
/*         calculates the functions and the jacobian. fcn must */
/*         be declared in an external statement in the user */
/*         calling program, and should be written as follows. */

/*         if iflag = 1 calculate the functions at x and */
/*         return this vector in fvec. do not alter fjac. */
/*         if iflag = 2 calculate the jacobian at x and */
/*         return this matrix in fjac. do not alter fvec. */
/*         ---------- */
/*         return */
/*         end */

/*         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless */
/*         the user wants to terminate execution of lmder1. */
/*         in this case set iflag to a negative integer. */

/*         calculated jacobian. column j of p is column ipvt(j) */
/*         (see below) of the identity matrix. the lower trapezoidal */
/*         part of fjac contains information generated during */
/*         the computation of r. */

/*       ldfjac is a positive integer input variable not less than m */
/*         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac. */

/*         most tol. */

/*       info is an integer output variable. if the user has */
/*         terminated execution, info is set to the (negative) */

/*                   between x and the solution is at most tol. */

/*         info = 3  conditions for info = 1 and info = 2 both hold. */
