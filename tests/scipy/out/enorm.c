/*     function enorm */

/*     given an n-vector x, this function calculates the */
/*     euclidean norm of x. */

/*     the euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of */
/*     squares in three different sums. the sums of squares for the */
/*     small and large components are scaled so that no overflows */
/*     occur. non-destructive underflows are permitted. underflows */
/*     and overflows do not occur in the computation of the unscaled */
/*     sum of squares for the intermediate components. */
/*     the definitions of small, intermediate and large components */
/*     depend on two constants, rdwarf and rgiant. the main */
/*     restrictions on these constants are that rdwarf**2 not */
/*     underflow and rgiant**2 not overflow. the constants */
/*     given here are suitable for every known computer. */
